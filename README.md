# Mekanik

Mekanik is a 2D video game engine that utilizes the .NET-Framework.
It is written in C# by me, TodesBrot.

It has lots of features, such as a save system, a level system (including an editor that seamlessly integrates into your game), a physics engine, and lots of premade interface elements. All of these features are completely optional, and you are free to create your game any way you want to.
